            <p>In the <a href="#demo-part-demo">demo</a>, you will be logging into <a href="/msw/accesscontrol/demo/membersPost">Members Posting Page</a> with different user accounts. Once logged in, you can post messages as yourself from a selection of drop-down menu. The super accounts will be able to pose as the regular users. You will be shown how to get pass the Presentation Layer drop-down restrictions, but still wouldnâ€™t get around the Business Layer.</p>

            <p>You should have a basic idea about how websites are built: the client-side, the server-side, and the database.</p>

            <p>The <a href="#demo-part-verify">how to verify</a> section provides details on how to check your site is safe with protections on all three layers.</p>

            <p>View the <a href="#demo-part-code">code</a> section to see the code that's used to make the demo work.</p>

            My code - code for making this demo work

            Actual codecoming before September, 2011!

                <p><b>My Setup</b><br />
                    - Make a users table and a text table with available users and text indexed by ID<br />
                    - create 3rd table that keeps track of what users have posted by recording the IDs of user names and text<br />
                    - Create a Django group for superusers and add "super_foo" and "super_bar" into the group. Now we can differentiate super users and regular users
                </p>

                <p> 
                <b>Presentation layer:</b> <br />
                    - Detect whether a super is super or not. Super users can select to post as anyone. Non-supers can only post as themselves.<br />
                    - The choices are sent to the server as integers id's
                </p>
                <p><b>Business layer:</b><br />
                    - Test 1: Make sure that the inputs are actually integers<br />
                    - Test 2: Make sure that the integer inputs are in the allowed range<br />
                    - If the above 2 tests are not passed, the inputs are discarded.<br />
                    - If the above 2 tests are passed, the inputs are saved into the database<br />
                </p>
                <p><b>Data layer:</b><br />
                    - Django takes care of the business --&gt; data layer
                </p>
