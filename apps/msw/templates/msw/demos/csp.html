    <h2>Content Security Policy</h2>

    <p />
    <h3>What to do</h3>
        <p>Externalize all of your javascript as <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="you_js_source"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

    <h3>How to check</h3>
        <p>no javascript in the html body.</p>
    <h3>What I did</h3>
        <p>I added the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp" target="_blank">django-csp</a> middleware to Django that adds 'X-Content-Security-Policy' to the HTTP Response Header</p>

    <h3>The demo: </h3>
    <p>This page contains 2 pieces of javascript:<br />
    <br />* 1 external js that alerts "You got XSS-ed from an EXTERNAL JS". <br />
    <br />* 1 in-body js that alerts "You got XSS-ed from an IN-BODY JS". like  <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("You got XSS-ed from an IN-BODY JS");&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
    <script>alert("You got XSS-ed from an IN-BODY JS");</script>
    <p>View this page in Firefox and Chrome.</p>
    <p>You should observe in Firefox the in-body alert is not displayed, but in Chrome it is. This is because the Firefox browser supports 'X-Content-Security-Policy'. So if you have an input box that attackers could put in Javascript for XSS, the XSS would not get run in Firefox.</p>
    <p>If you add 'X-Content-Security_Policy' to your HTTP Repsonse Header, remember to externalize all of your javascript or else they would be treated like XSS and not run.</p>
